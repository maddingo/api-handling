# API Consumption and Generation

In this step: attach openapi spec to artifact.

Contract: http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs or http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs.yaml
UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

There is also a springdoc-openapi-maven-plugin that has some limitations.

Here we generate the openapi spec during test and attach it to the artifact.
